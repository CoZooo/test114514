	# A list of diversity value thresholds, in ascending order. When the player's food diversity reaches a threshold,
	# they will get the benefits associated with that threshold.

	# 
	# Define custom benefits here. Each entry in the list corresponds to a benefit that will be obtained
	# at the corresponding diversity threshold defined the list above. For example, the first entry in
	# this list will be applied when the player's food diversity reaches the number in the first entry in
	# the threshold list above.
	# A benefit can also be marked as a detriment. In that case, its activation is reversed.
	# A detriment is applied while the player has less diversity than the threshold,
	# and will be removed when the threshold is reached.
	# Each benefit is a string with the following form: [+/-][type],[registry name],[value] (without the brackets)
	# A leading plus (or the of a symbol) denotes a benefit, while a minus denotes a detriment.
	# The type can either be 'attribute' for attribute modifiers or 'effect' for potion effects
	# Registry names for common vanila attributes are 
	# generic.max_health, generic.knockback_resistance, generic.movement_speed, generic.luck, 
	# generic.attack_damage, generic.attack_speed, generic.armor, generic.armor_toughness 
	# The value of attributes is the numerical number that will be added to that attribute
	# Use a negative number for subtraction. Multiplicative modifiers are not supported.
	# For potion effects, the value is an integer and is the potion effect amplifier. Note
	# that the amplifier is 0 indexed, so minecraft:strength,1 corresponds to Strength II
	#
	# To add multiple benefits to the same threshold, separate them by a semicolon ';'
	# Make sure that you have NO SPACES!
	# As an example, 'attribute,generic.max_health,2;effect,strength,1' will give both +2 max hp
	# and Strength II at the corresponding threshold.
	# 'attribute,generic.attack_damage,1;-effect,slowness,0' will give +1 attack damage at the corresponding threshold
	# and Slowness I below the corresponding threshold.
